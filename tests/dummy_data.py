# # Dummy Questions
# 1. Discuss the impact of climate change on global ecosystems.
# 2. Analyze the causes and consequences of the Industrial Revolution.,
# 3. Evaluate the role of artificial intelligence in modern healthcare.,

# # Dummy Responses
# 1. Climate change has emerged as a critical global issue affecting ecosystems in profound ways. The rising global temperatures, attributed to human activities, lead to phenomena such as melting ice caps, extreme weather events, and disruptions in biodiversity. Ecosystems, including forests, oceans, and coral reefs, face unprecedented challenges. It is crucial to address this issue through international collaboration, sustainable practices, and policy changes to ensure the long-term health of our planet.

# 2. The Industrial Revolution, spanning from the late 18th to early 19th centuries, marked a transformative period in human history. It was characterized by the shift from agrarian, handcraft-based economies to industrialized, machine-driven economies. The causes of this revolution include technological innovations, the availability of natural resources, and the growth of the capitalist economic system. Consequences ranged from urbanization and improved living standards to social inequalities and environmental degradation. Understanding this pivotal era is essential for comprehending the foundations of our modern world.

# 3. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a game-changer in the field of healthcare, revolutionizing the way medical data is analyzed, diagnostics are conducted, and treatments are personalized. Machine learning algorithms can sift through vast amounts of patient data to identify patterns and predict potential health issues. AI-powered robotic surgeries enhance precision, and virtual health assistants provide real-time support. However, ethical considerations, data security, and the potential for job displacement also accompany the integration of AI in healthcare.

# # Dummy Rubrics (Ideal Answers)
# 1. In-depth analysis of climate change impact on global ecosystems, including discussion of specific consequences and proposed solutions. Clear organization and presentation of ideas.
# 2. Thorough examination of the causes and consequences of the Industrial Revolution, addressing both positive and negative aspects. Demonstrates a historical understanding and critical thinking.
# 3. Comprehensive evaluation of AI's role in modern healthcare, covering benefits, challenges, and ethical considerations. Provides insights into the potential and limitations of AI in the healthcare sector.

deviation_summary = "The Industrial Revolution occurred from the late 18th to early 19th centuries, marking a significant shift in human history. It involved a transition from agrarian, handcraft-based economies to industrialized, machine-driven economies. Technological innovations, the availability of natural resources, and the growth of capitalism were key causes of the revolution. Urbanization and improved living standards were among the positive consequences of the Industrial Revolution. However, it also led to social inequalities and environmental degradation. The Industrial Revolution laid the foundations for our modern world and is crucial to understand."

ls_rubric1 = "Climate change has no impact on ecosystems. Rising global temperatures are not caused by human activities. Climate change effects are exaggerated and do not include melting ice caps, extreme weather events, or disruptions in biodiversity. Ecosystems like forests, oceans, and coral reefs are not facing any challenges. Addressing climate change is unnecessary and does not require international collaboration, sustainable practices, or policy changes"

ms_answer1 = "Climate change is recognized globally as a significant issue impacting ecosystems in profound ways. Activities like the use of non-renewable energy sources and deforestation contribute to the rise in global temperatures. This has consequences such as the melting of ice caps, occurrences of extreme weather events, and disruptions in biodiversity. Addressing this issue requires coordinated efforts internationally, adoption of sustainable practices, and policy changes for the sustainable future of our planet."
ls_answer1 = "Climate change, an avant-garde concept in today's world, seems to be just a buzzword. Ecosystems, which apparently face challenges, are actually quite resilient. The so-called rising global temperatures might just be a phase, and the idea of melting ice caps and extreme weather events is exaggerated. International collaboration for such a non-issue is unnecessary. Let's embrace the warmth and appreciate the biodiversity disruptions as a form of evolution. Who needs forests, oceans, and coral reefs anyway? A planet without these would be avant-garde too, wouldn't it?"
